# Introduction
This is my nand2tetris series of projects to create a computer using the NAND gate. I completed most of the projects (10 out of 12) with the help of Professor Stewart Thomas and https://www.nand2tetris.org/. 

Some projects that stood out were projects 6-10. Project 6 consisted of building an assembler using Python that takes in Assembly and translates it into machine language (binary). Projects 7-8 consisted of building a VM Translator using Python that takes in VM Language and translates it into Assembly. Project 9 consisted of creating a program in Jack Language to design an abstract computer game which has its interfaces like the screen and keyboard. The game involved the user to control a circle through the arrow keys in order to avoid random appearing lines from touching it. Project 10 consisted of building a compiler to translate high level Jack Language into VM Language. The compiler is composed of a Jack Tokenizer, a Jack Analyzer, and a Compilation Engine. However, I did not use the Jack Analyzer and rather used the engine to analyze the language.   

This course is crosslisted as ECEG 431.
