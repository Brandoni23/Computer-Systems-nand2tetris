The way to compile the assembler is by going to the command terminal and locate the folder which contains the "assembler.py" file in your 
PC drive. Then, open python and enter the "assembler.py" file and also the input file argument next to it (Max.asm, Pong.asm, and Rect.asm).
The output file will be the Prog.hack file which will be overrun for each input file you run.
